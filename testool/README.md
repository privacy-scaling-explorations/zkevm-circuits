# Testool

The `testool` is a binary cli that focus on provide tools for testing.

To use it, just compile with `cargo build --release` and run `../target/release/testool`.

This tool at this moment has 2 main functionalities: run raw bytecode and run ethereum tests.

## Run oneliner spec

The oneliner spec is invoked by using `--oneliner` parameter

The spec has the following form

`txparams` `account 1` `account 2` ... `account n`

where 

- `txparams` have the form `call|create`;`calldata`;`value`;`gas`
  - if `create`is specified the `to` field in the tx is left blank, is not the first account specified is used as the contract to call
  - `calldata`,`value` and `gas` are optional
- `account` have the form `address`;`code`;`balance`;`slot 1`:`value 1`;..`slot n`..`value n`
  - `address` can be shortened, eg.`10` and `0x10` is expanded to `0x....10`
  - `code` is optional, and can be specified in hex or in asm (`PUSH1(1),PUSH1(1),MLOAD`)
  - `balance` and `value` are optional
  - `slot` and `value` can be specified multiple times 

example

- `../target/release/testool --oneliner "call 12;60016002"`: call contract `0x...12` that contains the code PUSH1(1) PUSH1(2)
- `../target/release/testool --oneliner "call;;2000 12;PUSH1(0),SLOAD,CALLVALUE,EQ,PUSH1(1),SSTORE;;00:2000"`: call the contract and send 2000 as value, and compare with the stored value (2000) in the slot 0, write into slot 1 

## Run the ethereum tests

Run

```
 ../target/release/testool --suite default
```
or

```
 ../target/release/testool --suite nightly
```

The "official EVM" ethereum tests are cloned as a gitmodule in `testool/tests`.
We are using the tests located in `testtool/tests/src/GeneralStateTestsFiller`, but other locations can be specified, also.


### The ethereum tests files

These tests are written in `json` or `yml`, and, in general it specifies 4 sections:

- General environment to generate a block (blocknumber, timestamp, gaslimit, etc...)
- Initial account states (with its balance, nonce, storage, and code)
- A set of transactions to be executed from the initial state, each transaction defines one test
- The account states resulting of the execution of these transactions

You can find (here)[https://ethereum-tests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_filler/blockchain_filler.html] the specification for these files in detail.

Official ethereum tests are mantained by the foundation but you can write your own.

### Configuration file

The `Config.toml` configuration defines which files and tests to process.

#### Defining test suites

In the config file you define `[[suite]]`s that defines how tests will be executed.

- `id` is the identifier of the suite. The default suite is called `default`.
- `max_steps` the maximum number of executed opcodes. If this is reached, the test is marked to be ignored.
- `max_gas` the maximum gas of a test. If the is reached, the test is marked to be ignored.
- `unimplemented_opcodes`, if any of these opcodes are found in the execution trace, the test is marked to be ignored.
- you should define also only one of these paramers:
   - `allow_tests` with the list of tests or testsets to execute. All others will be excluded. Test sets should be prefixed with `&`
   - `ignore_tests` with the list of test or testsets to ignore. All others will be included. Test sets should be prefixed with `&`

#### Test sets

Test sets are created by using the `[[set]]` section and should define
- `id` the identification of the set (without any `&`). Note that ids can be duplicated, this means that are tests with the same id are joined together when used. 
- `desc` a description of the test set
- `tests` a list of tests

#### Skipping the execution of problematic tests

Sometimes there are some files or specific tests that we want to disable at all. Those are defined with:

- `[[skip_test]]` defines a set of tests that are always ignored.
- `[[skip_path]]` defined a set of files/folders that are always ignored. This is useful since sometimes there are some tests with weird encodings.

### Generating reports

When the command line parameter `--report` is defined, it automatically: 

- After the execution, a two files are created in the `report` folder. They are
   - `<timestamp>-<git_commit>.hml` with the browseable results of the execution.
   - `<timestamp>-<git_commit>.csv` with the raw results of the execution
- The HTML file also contains the diff with the previous result. The previous result file is the more recent csv file with different commit from the current one

NOTE: if you do not execute with `--report` the tool will exit the process with `1` if there is any test that is not working.

### Manually executing the tests

Usually we have to debug and run the tests manually to check if everything works ok. We provide a set of command line parameters to help with this.

- `testool [--suite xxx] --cache` to execute all tests, and keeping the results (cache) CSV file. If you delete entries from the cache file, and re-run the tool again, only the deleted tests will be executed again

- `testool [--suite xxx] --inspect <test_id>` only executed the selected test (even if cached, or ignored). Use `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` here to check if anything fails. Also gives a dumop of the test as also to the geth steps executed.
